THE PERFECT MEAL
================
# Tired of wasting food? Embarassed in front of your starving guests? Say no more.
## The Perfect Meal helps you to plan and estimate the appropriate amount of food for your event.

What is it for?
---------------
When you take the job of planning a meal for a group of people there is always the risk of having too much or too little food. Make too much and you will waste a lot. Make too little and you will have your guests hitting the nearest drive-thru on their way back home. 

The Perfect Meal is here to help you with that! Just select the occasion, enter the number of guests, modify the menu and done. You know just how much food you need to get so that the party doesn't have to end because the food is over.
